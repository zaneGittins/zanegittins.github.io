# About Me

I'm Zane Gittins, a cybersecurity professional focused on blue team operations and digital forensics. I have a passion for threat hunting, incident response, and building defensive capabilities that help organizations stay ahead of evolving threats.

## This Blog

I created this blog to document my learning journey and share knowledge with the security community. You'll find posts about security tools, techniques, and real-world experiences from the trenches.

Whether you're a seasoned security professional or just starting your journey in cybersecurity, I hope you find something useful here.
